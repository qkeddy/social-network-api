## Description
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The API leverages Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

A demo of this application can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YZzEYr4MSSJRQVAPzffUspxJKzwivIOL/view?usp=sharing).
